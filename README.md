This is the second assignment during learning html and css

The first chanllenge was sepreated the contents. I started at editting the background size, color and the menu part. I noticed that the border of menu button is grey and three lines are dark grey. Also, the text on menu is white with serif in font family.

Second, on the footer, there is a think part filling with color as well.
